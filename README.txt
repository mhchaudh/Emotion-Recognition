# üòä Emotion Recognition System

The **Emotion Recognition System** is a computer vision project that detects human faces and classifies emotions in real-time using deep learning. It combines facial recognition and emotion detection to interpret expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more ‚Äî making it suitable for applications in mental health, customer analysis, and smart systems.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **üë§ Facial Recognition:** Identifies individuals in live video feeds or images using pre-trained models such as OpenCV or deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow / Keras).  
- **üòÑ Emotion Detection:** Classifies emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral) using models trained on datasets like **FER2013**.  
- **‚ö° Real-Time Processing:** Processes video frames efficiently for instant recognition and emotion classification.  
- **üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Interface:** Displays detected faces alongside their predicted emotions, with the potential to log results for further analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Dataset

Download the **FER2013 dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) or another source.  
Organize it as follows:

Emotion rec/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fer2013/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ happy/
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sad/
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ angry/
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ happy/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sad/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ angry/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The FER2013 dataset is **not included in this repository** due to size limits.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate             # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model

python train_model.py

This will generate two files in your project directory:

emotion_model.h5 ‚Äî the trained emotion detection model

labels.json ‚Äî the mapping of class labels

You can tweak training settings such as batch size and epochs in train_model.py.

üí° Training can be slow on CPU ‚Äî GPU acceleration with TensorFlow is recommended.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Real-Time Detection

python detect_emotion.py


A webcam window will open showing live detections.
Press q to quit the program.
